-- The main database ('leads_gen_template_db') and user ('leadsgen_user') are 
-- created automatically by the official postgres Docker image based on the
-- POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, and POSTGRES_PASSWORD environment variables
-- you have defined in your .env file.
--
-- This script is for any additional setup. For a typical Rails application, a
-- test database is also needed. The command below creates the test database
-- and sets the main application user as the owner.

CREATE DATABASE ${POSTGRES_DB}_test OWNER ${POSTGRES_USER};
